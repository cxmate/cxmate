//********** SERVICE DEFINITION **********//
//A cxMate service must implement some or all of the method
//signatures in the service block.

service cxMateService {
  //StreamElements allows cxMate to stream one or more networks to a service
  //which can then stream one or more networks back.
  rpc StreamNetworks (stream NetworkElement) returns (stream NetworkElement) {}
}

//********** INPUT/OUTPUT MESSAGES **********//

//NetworkElement is a wrapper that constains a label, which is used to allow
//StreamNetworks to send and receive more than one network.NetworkElement is also a wrapper for exactly one element.
// Some elements do not exist in CX, like Parameter and Error, which are special elements used to communicate out of band information
//between cxMate and a service. The other elements corrospond to an aspect in a CX document. These
//elements should be used to build networks, and turn networks back into elements cxMate can understand.
message NetworkElement {
  string label = 1;
  oneof element {
    Parameter parameter = 2;
    Error error = 3;
    Node node = 4;

    NodeAttribute nodeAttribute = 6;
    EdgeAttribute edgeAttribute = 7;
    NetworkAttribute networkAttribute = 8;
    CartesianLayout cartesianLayout = 9;
  }
}

//********** UTILITY MESSAGES **********//
//These are messages which may be passed as NetworkElements, but really are not part of a Network.
//They are out of band messages used to send and receive addititional information between a service and cxMate.

//Parameter represents a named value passed from cxMate to the service.
//A service should never send a Parameter to cxMate, it will be discarded.
//Parameters are usually used to pass query string parameters (?key=value pairs in a URL)
//to a service for small tweaks to the way a service runs.
message Parameter {
  string name = 1;
  string format = 2;
  oneof value {
    string stringValue = 3;
    bool booleanValue = 4;
    int64 integerValue = 5;
    double numberValue = 6;
  }
}

//Error represents an error from either cxMate or the service. Errors sent
//from the service to cxMate will be encoded in the final JSON response returned to
//the REST client. Sending back good error messages is good practice.
message Error {
  int64 status = 1;
  string type = 2;
  string message = 3;
  string link = 4;
}

//********** CX ASPECT MESSAGES **********//
//These are messages that corrospond to CX aspects. They are annotated with the json keys you would find
//in a CX file. For instance, a node element in CX can have an attached name with the "n" key, but cxMate turns this
//into a name field. Longer field names are free using protocol buffers, and it makes code easier to read and the purpose
//of each field clear.

//To assemble a network from CX elements, it's useful to have read the CX specification document, or some tutorial on CX.
//In short, basic elements like Node and Edge are straightforward, and a network can be assembled by connecting Edge source and target Ids
//to their corrosponding Nodes. Other aspects usually link to a node or edge by including an edgeId or nodeId. You can think of CX as a
//hyperlinked document that you are rendering, and must resolve the links.

//Note that Element order is not garunteed by CX. It is possible to receive an edge that has a sourceId that references a node that does not
//yet exist. Depending on how important correctness is for your program, you may elect to optimistcally create the node, or perhaps you may
//keep the edge in a list until the node arrives. This is a feature of CX, cxMate always streams CX documents, allowing cxMate to process large
//networks, and cannot resolve this ordering for you presently.

//Node represents a single node in a network.
