cxMate streams Cytoscape networks directly to your code. cxMate listens for CX (Cytoscape's native network format) on the web, trasforming CX into data structures native to your programming language of choice. cxMate will also transform any networks you want to send to Cytoscape back into CX. When you use cxMate, your code can also be used by any other tool, service, or program that speaks CX, like an NDEx server. cxMate responds to plain http calls, so your service can also be called from any HTTP client, such as the requests Python module from a Jupyter notebook, or curl.

_cxMate is an official [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org) project written by the Cytoscape team._

Installation
------------

cxMate comes precompiled as a static binary for a number of platforms, and exists on Docker Hub as a container image that can be run with Docker, Docker Swarm, or Kubernetes.

- Download a precompiled static binary for your platform [here](https://github.com/cxmate/cxmate/releases)
- Run cxmate in a docker container with the [official Docker Hub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ericsage/cxmate/)

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to use cxMate is with an official cxMate SDK. The cxMate SDKs provide easy to understand boilerplate and adapters to popular network formats. Each SDK has it's own Getting Started readme for creating a service in that language. Once you've implemented your cxMate service, you'll also need to write a `cxmate.json` file to configure cxMate's runtime behavior and give cxMate information about your service. See the Configuration section for details.

Offical cxMate SDKs:
- [Python](http://github.com/cxmate/cxmate-py)
- *More to come*

Configuration
-------------

On startup, cxMate will look for a `cxmate.json` file in its current directory. This file contains a JSON configuration object that cxMate uses to interact with your service. cxMate will not start if this file is missing or required fields are not provided.

Example:
```json

| type        | false    | "string" | The type cxMate will cast the query string to before sending the parameter to the service. Must be one of "number", "integer", "boolean", or "string", e.g. if type is set to number "?match=1.0"  will cast "1.0" to 1.0. |
| format      | false    | ""       | Extra semantic information, e.g. "password", "float64", "secret", "gene", etc.                                                                                                                                             |

| aspects     | true     | N/A      | The CX aspects that will appear in the network. For an Input network, the network must contain *at least* these aspects. Any aspects not in this list will not be forwarded to the service. For an Output Network, these are all the aspects taht *can* appear in the network. |
